        <h2>
            Work hard and become wealthy? <br>
            Maybe so, but work alone might not cut it. The following graphs<sup>[1]</sup> show <br>
            various paths to prosperity.

        <h2>
            Education
        </h2>

        <p>
            More advanced schooling helps. If you can avoid the crushing debt of student loans, all the better. Try to find a major that<br>
            you're good at and that is good to you.

            enders are able to become more wealthy than the education high enders. So before being born, shop around.
